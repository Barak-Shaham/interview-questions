Question goals:
    understand custom hooks & setState asynchronous attribute.

Code Explanation:
    useIncrement custom hook gives us the increment function and the counterValue.
    Inside useIncrement we use setState which is asynchronous, so clicking on "increment" will only change the state to 1 and not to 3.
    setCounter will be invoked 3 times but each time it will increase the val form 0 to 1

Solution:
 Using the prev state as an argument: setCounter( counter => counter + 1)
